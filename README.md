# Nikki Espartinez
Designer, writer & human. Raised in Southeast Asia, based in the United States. 

### Getting started
I am currently working as a Senior User Experience Designer at a data analytics company called Verisk Analytics. I spend my day-to-day, operationally-speaking, solving technology-driven problems with fellow colleagues (eg software engineers, data scientists, PMs etc). All of whom I respect dearly. Outside my day job, I write publicly via [my newsletter](https://nikkiespartinez.substack.com/). There is little-to-no difference between how I approach my design work and my writing work. I find immense fulfillment in both, especially the latter. [The longer story about me...](aboutme.md)

### Portfolio
I straddle the lines of commercial and personal, data and human, technology and design. As a generalist designer, I consider almost every problem, a design problem. Including, oddly enough, how I live my life. As a designer who has a hard time turning "this part of my brain off", there's no such thing as being off-duty. Currently, I am fond of this movement around "lifestyle design". <details> <summary> Here's a shortlist of the best projects of my career so far: </summary>
- An application that helps field representatives collect and gather data onsite
- An application that identifies hazardous objects with a single image input
- An application that uses generative ai to help underwriters make sense of their documents
- An application that displays holographic content, effectively letting the users enjoy them in a very public setting
- An application that helps people track their health via a smart wearable band
- A speculative website redesign for a beloved & specialized ecommerce site
- A dashboard that tracks the growth of Electric Vehicles in the United States
- A full-digital campaign for the first Star Wars movie spearheaded by Disney

#### How can I help you?
<mark>I am most effective when I can deploy my core skills (writing/designing/research) and pour them into solving human-centered problems with competent people</mark>; I take great pleasure in thinking which is especially useful in software development - from the messy discovery phase all the way to the gritty execution, there's no shortage in terms of thinking and doing to solve complex problems. This is probably why I chose this career, over a multitude of other paths in the design world. <details> <summary> With this in mind, here's a shortlist of tasks/areas/skills where I be most impactful, given the right team, product and problem: </summary>
- UX strategy and vision setting: are we building the right thing? are we solving the right problems?
- User research and workflow definition: do we actually know who we're building for?
- Speculative design: proof of concepts that eventually lead to the right path
- Rapid prototyping: with generativeai or not
- Product refinement and testing
- Mentorship and teaching
