# Nikki Espartinez
Designer, writer & human. Raised in Southeast Asia, based in the United States. 

### Getting started
This is my work - design and writing. [The longer story about me...](aboutme.md)

### Portfolio
I straddle the lines of commercial and personal, data and human, technology and design. As a generalist designer, I consider almost every problem, a design problem. Here's a shortlist of the best projects of my career so far:
- An application that helps field representatives collect and gather data onsite
- An application that identifies hazardous objects with a single image input
- An application that uses generative ai to help underwriters make sense of their documents
- An application that displays holographic content, effectively letting the users enjoy them in a very public setting
- An application that helps people track their health via a smart wearable band
- A speculative website redesign for a beloved & specialized ecommerce site
- A dashboard that tracks the growth of Electric Vehicles in the United States
- A full-digital campaign for the first Star Wars movie spearheaded by Disney

#### Where can I help?
I am most effective when I can deploy my core skills (writing/designing/research) and pour them into solving human-centered problems with competent people; I take great pleasure in thinking which is especially useful in software development. From the messy discovery phase all the way to the gritty execution, I'd like to be hands-on, given the right team, given the right problem.
