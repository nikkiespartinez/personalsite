# Nikki Espartinez
Designer, writer & human. Raised in Southeast Asia, based in the United States. 

### Getting started
This is my work - design and writing.

### Portfolio
I straddle the lines of commercial and personal, data and human, technology and design. As a generalist designer, I consider almost every problem, a design problem 
- Over 5 years at Verisk, here's the top projects I am proud of helping ship:
- Elsewhere, Looking Glass, Pavlok, PublicisJimenezBasic

#### Where can I help?
I am most effective when I can deploy my core skills (writing/designing/research) and pour them into solving human-centered problems with competent people; I take great pleasure in thinking which is especially useful in software development. From the messy discovery phase all the way to the gritty execution, I'd like to be hands-on, given the right team, given the right problem.
