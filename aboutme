## About me

Designing for a better world is my life. Exploring the area of human-computer interaction through user experiences is my life’s work. It’s a personal mission I take seriously.
From my writing to my formal body of work, I love marrying a few of my interests: design, human behaviors, technology and humanities. Originally trained in traditional design, I made a career pivot to technology primarily. It was the best decision I’ve ever made and have had the strongest impact to my work since.

Over the last 5 years, I’ve helped design and build a holographic platform for an emerging technology startup in Brooklyn, contracted with a research team inside Fidelity Investments, worked on the Design Operations and Strategy side of an e-commerce company, mentored brilliant design students and career-changers at RookieUp, taught UX courses at General Assembly - East Coast, contributed directly to the growth of the Mentorship program at UXPA - New York and now, I happily run my own design-focused newsletter called Working Title.
Currently, I design internal applications full-time for a data company called Verisk Analytics, where my team and I explore the beautiful intersection of Data and UX. It is, by far, one of the most fulfilling roles I've ever had.

I am deeply convinced this career track is akin to winning the lottery of modern work. You have to fight for it every day but there's nothing quite like its rewards as a lot of creative knowledge workers would probably agree. 

Living is creating, creating is living. This is the kind of work that just does not have an expiration date. It’s a way of living that goes beyond the paycheck, as anything we invest a lot of our time on should.

Aside from design, I like exploring and studying films, photography, startups, philosophy, psychology... basically anything that taps my curiosity. I document these learnings freely on my newsletter.
